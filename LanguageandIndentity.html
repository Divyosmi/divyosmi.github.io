Reasoning, sensibility and logic are like a river, deep set and flowing underground, unseen by all. This reasonable attitude, flows within, connects all the neurons of conscience, tames the wild beast in us and follows the lead to forging social relations and decision making. The notion of justice is not inherently a reflex in human beings, it&#39;s a learned and practiced concept. Language awakens learning, it facilitates the medium for us to express ourselves. One thinks to exist, if someone is thinking for them, they lose all incentive to think. We become mindless. Language forms the basis of our identity. And when a minority tries to superimpose their preferences on others and it hurts our identity and suppresses our thoughts and freedom, it stirs the beast in us to wreak havoc into our social spheres.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The action reaches far and beyond, our&nbsp; words, our actions rain the embers of unreasonable, illogical, unemotional, and unjust acts. Unjustness here is defined in the more broad terms of our day, like egalitarianism, unity, peace tolerance, gender neutrality, law abiding and many more big tents. The first thing to be killed in the process is our sensitivity. This passive war isn&#39;t only a turmoil between the minority and us, it&#39;s a turmoil of identity and submission. Every time I see attempts to sew together the narrative of Hindu nation, and India, and cultural homogenisation, which threatens the existence of the Indians and the Idea of India, the idea of the religion of humanity and love, the philosophy of acceptance, tolerance, peaceful coexistence, justice and unity, it awakens the bitter memories of the war of liberation of 1971. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Bangali-s in Bangladesh rose up in rebellion under the charismatic leadership of the heroic &quot;Banga Bandhu&quot; Mujibar Rehman. It was a struggle, that the whole world was a witness to, as US kept on funding a genocide in Bangladesh by then West Pakistan Junta, and India, a secular nation, forwarded it&#39;s hand of friendship to Bangladesh and also Soviet Republic aided Bangladesh(Each not without it&#39;s own reason, need and cause). It was not Bengal nationalism, it wasn&#39;t a power tussle, or bid for power, it was just to prove love for language, to prove that Bengali blood ignites upon domination. It ended in the creation of free Bangladesh, free not only from domination of Pakistan, but free from the suppression of ideas and thoughts. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Mother tongue is a very dear concept to us all, it&#39;s up to us to preserve the culture and its sustenance in the face of whitewashing of history. India is the land of love and has taught forgiveness to all, and today I decide as a free Indian to forgive all the efforts to suppress my freedom in a free nation, a freedom secured by my constitution. On this 21st Feb, 2023, I proudly proclaim myself to be a part of this history, when the world saw a revolution based on love for language, where many lost their lives and several women were stripped of their dignity and many children still live in shame, shackles and abuse. I proclaim my love for Bangla and forgiveness to every entity who tries to subdue my thoughts. I hold no grievances against the people of any particular country, the notion of love, justice and freedom is exterior to them, they are just the products of a nation&#39;s views and propaganda, we are just the actors and puppets, only some a little broken and outspoken. </span></p></body></html>
